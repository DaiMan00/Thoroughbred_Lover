												<h3>Background</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Dubawi is a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. He was one of the only crop of foals sired by Dubai Millennium, an outstanding racehorse. His dam, Zomaradah was a top class racemare who won the Oaks d'Italia, E. P. Taylor Stakes, Premio Lydia Tesio and the Royal Whip Stakes. As a descendant of the broodmare Sunbittern, Zomaradah, who also produced the Lancashire Oaks winner Emirates Queen, was closely related to In the Wings, High-Rise and Virginia Waters. The colt raced in the blue colours of Godolphin and was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Frankie Dettori.</p>

										<h2>Stud Career</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Dubawi's first crop included the 2000 Guineas winner Makfi (GB), who, in an example of the blossoming of the line, sired the G1 Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Make Believe (GB) in his first crop, who in turn is the sire of G1 Prix du Jockey Club winner Mishriff (Ire) from his first crop. Along with Makfi in the class of 2007 were the Group 1 winners Lucky Nine (GB), Poet's Voice (GB), Dubawi Heights (GB), Monterosso (GB) and Prince Bishop (GB), as well as the Group 3 winner and Irish 1000 Guineas runner-up Anna Salai (GB), who would later become the dam of Adayar (Ire) (Frankel {GB}). Among his 142 Group winners, Dubawi is now the sire of 48 Group/Grade 1 winners–six of those having come from his three stints down under–with the group including the 2020 Horse of the Year Ghaiyyath. From an opening fee of £25,000, he stood his fourth season at £15,000 before gradually climbing to his fee of £250,000 for the last six years, making him the most expensive stallion in Europe.</p>
