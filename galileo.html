												<h3>Background</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Galileo was a 16.5 hh (64.5 inches, 164 cm) bay horse with a narrow white blaze and a white sock on his near hind leg. He was sired by Sadler's Wells out of the mare Urban Sea. His breeders were David Tsui, the owner of Urban Sea, and "Orpendale", a name used by the Coolmore Stud organisation for some of their breeding interests. He was described as a three-year-old as being "one of the most impeccably bred horses in training".</p>

												<h3>Two-Year-Old Career</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Galileo's two-year-old debut was delayed by a cough that he developed over the summer of 2000. He did not appear on the racecourse until 28 October, when he was entered in a sixteen-runner maiden race at Leopardstown. He was made the even-money favourite, despite the field containing two runners each from the stables of the leading Irish trainers John Oxx and Jim Bolger. Mick Kinane tracked the leaders on Galileo before sending the colt into the lead in the straight. Although there were less than two furlongs to the finish, Galileo extended his lead to fourteen lengths by the end of the race.</p>

												<h3>Three-Year-Old Career</h3>
											</header>
											<p>An important chapter at Ballydoyle came to a close thereafter, as Galileo retired with six wins from eight starts, earnings of Â£1,621,110, a Timeform rating of 134 and European champion 3-year-old honours. But for all he accomplished in his own right from the world's most famous yard, what he has given back to it in the ensuing years has been simply transcendent.</p>

										<h2>Stud Career</h2>
									</header>
									<p>After his retirement, Galileo became one of the most sought after sires in the world. He first became the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 2008, then consecutively earned the title from 2010 through 2020. In 2020, he set the record for the number of Epsom Derby winners sired at five: New Approach, Ruler of the World, Australia, Anthony Van Dyck and Serpentine. In June 2020, Galileo sired his 85th Group 1 winner, breaking Danehill's world record and becoming the most successful source of Group I winners in thoroughbred history. In addition to his Derby winners, his notable offspring include Frankel, Nathaniel, Found, Churchill and Minding. He is also a leading broodmare sire and an emerging sire of sires. Galileo was euthanized on 10 July 2021, after a debilitating injury to his near foreleg, which failed to heal after surgery earlier that year.</p>
